# AraTar

Welcome to the AraTar repository. AraTar is the first comprehensive corpus designed to support the fine-grained detection of Arabic hate speech targets. This task consists of two parts: Hate Type Detection (Task 1) and Hate Target Identification (Task 2). This corpus is annotated with hate types and hate targets, facilitating the development of multi-label classification methods for automatically detecting both the types and targets of hate speech.

## Corpus Overview

- **Annotations**: The files in this repository contain the necessary labels for each data point in the AraTar corpus. These labels are essential for training and evaluation purposes.
- **Data Availability**: Due to Twitter's policy, the actual tweets in the AraTar corpus cannot be made publicly available in this repository. To access the full corpus, including the tweets, please submit a request to the authors.

## Requesting Full Corpus Access

To obtain the full AraTar corpus, including the tweets, please follow these steps:
1. Send an email to the authors at [seham.alghamdi@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:seham.alghamdi@manchester.ac.uk).
2. Include your name, affiliation, and a brief description of your research project.
3. Specify that you are requesting access to the AraTar corpus.

## Significance of AraTar

The AraTar corpus addresses several limitations of previous Arabic hate speech detection efforts:
- **Scale**: It provides a more extensive corpus for Arabic hate speech detection.
- **Unified Annotation**: It offers consistent annotations across the corpus, unlike previous datasets that lacked unified annotation standards.
- **Design**: It overcomes the limitations of previous corpora, which were designed only for multiclass classification and often missed critical information.

## Code and Experiments

You can find the code for our best experiment on AraTar for both tasks (Task 1 and Task 2), which involves fine-tuning language models, especially AraBERTv2-twitter.

## Usage

This corpus is intended for research purposes only. Please cite the relevant publications if you use AraTar in your work.
