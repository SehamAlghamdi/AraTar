# AraTar

Welcome to the AraTar repository. AraTar is the first comprehensive corpus designed to support the fine-grained detection of Arabic hate speech targets. AraTar consists of two tasks: Hate Type Detection task (Task 1) and Hate Target Identification task (Task 2). This corpus is annotated with hate types and hate targets, facilitating the development of multi-label classification methods for automatically detecting both the types and targets of hate speech.

## Significance of AraTar


The AraTar corpus addresses several limitations of previous Arabic hate speech detection efforts:

- **Scale**: It provides a more extensive corpus for Arabic hate speech detection, significantly larger than existing datasets.
- **Unified Annotation**: It offers consistent annotations across the corpus, with high Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA).
- **Design**: It overcomes the limitations of previous corpora, which were designed only for multiclass classification and often missed critical information.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Unlike existing corpora that support only one type of hate or target, AraTar includes multiple types and targets of hate speech.
- **Standard Labeling Scheme**: It introduces a standard labelling scheme for the types and targets of hate, which was previously absent in other datasets.
- **Robust Schema**: AraTar is designed with a robust schema to handle all possible types of hate speech and targets, supporting multi-label classification approaches.

## Code and Experiments

You can find the code for our best experiment on AraTar for both tasks (Task 1 and Task 2), which involves fine-tuning language models, especially AraBERTv2-twitter.
